# ML-ALGORITHMS

Repository name: ML-ALGORITHMS (owner: swarubm).
Public repository with default branch main.
Primary language reported: Jupyter Notebook (100%).
Repository size reported as 1378 (as recorded by GitHub).
Last recorded push: 2025-10-12.
No repository description or license is present in the repository metadata.
No forks, stars, or watchers are recorded.
Issues, wiki, projects, and downloads features are enabled for the repo.
The codebase appears to consist entirely of Jupyter notebooks.
Notebooks in this type of repo typically present implementations and demonstrations of machine‑learning algorithms.
Expect a mix of executable code cells, narrative Markdown explanations, and visualization outputs.
Common contents likely include implementations or examples of supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
Typical algorithm examples might cover linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, clustering, and evaluation metrics.
Notebooks often include data‑loading and preprocessing steps for small example datasets.
Visualizations (plots of data, learning curves, confusion matrices) are expected within the notebooks.
Dependency stack usually includes numpy, pandas, scikit‑learn, matplotlib/seaborn, and possibly scipy.
The repository’s size and single-language makeup suggest a compact, educational/demonstration focus rather than a full production library.
Absence of a declared license in metadata means reuse permissions are unclear — check files for a license before reuse.
README or per‑notebook instructions (if present) will be the best source for running and dependency details.
The repo metadata shows it’s maintained by a single user and is likely intended as a learning resource or personal collection of ML notebooks.
Summary: a small, notebook-only collection focused on demonstrating machine‑learning algorithms, examples, and visual analyses, with minimal project metadata.
